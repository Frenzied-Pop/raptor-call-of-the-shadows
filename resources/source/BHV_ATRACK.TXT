# MOVE_TARGET moves to random target
# MOVE_X vel [, maxvel]: Moves in x axis specified vel. If maxvel is filled then moves a random velocity between vel and maxvel 
# MOVE_Y vel [, maxvel]:
# SHOT weapon, x, y [, TARGET]: 
#     x: Relative x position
#     y: Relative y position
#     TARGET: get the pilot's trajectory
# DELAY time: wait time milliseconds to run next step
